# What is this server about

This server will help teachers generate resources to help them get quick access to customizable documents for their classes. Also help them manage classes, schedule classes, contact students.

## Server evolution plan

The cornerstone of this project will be the document generation tool, but the server should have a basic authorization to begin with. So the path should follow some simple overall plan:

1.  Server initialization and configuration
2.  Architecture design selection
3.  Documentation (OpenAPI) initialization
4.  Basic Router initialization
5.  Authorization module implementation
6.  AI configuration (OpenAI)
7.  AI integration (basic testing endpoint)
8.  Document generation module implementation
9.  Testing implementation

Next modules should continue from here..

- Tools:
    - Github for planning and issue tracking
    - VScode to code
    - Deployment: TBD
    - OpenAI to generate documents
    - OpenAPI for documentation
- Technologies
